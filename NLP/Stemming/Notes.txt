Stemming is the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base word.
 Stemming programs are commonly referred to as stemming algorithms or stemmers.
  A stemming algorithm reduces the words “chocolates”, “chocolatey”, and 
  “choco” to the root word, “chocolate” and “retrieval”, “retrieved”, “retrieves”
   reduce to the stem “retrieve”.
